# CS-115 Programming 2
The module taught by Swansea University.

## Synopsis
This module is a continuation of the module CS-110 Programming 1. In it, students will continue to enhance their skills in programming, as well as gain a basic understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Syllabus
- Objects and Classes.
- Instance Methods and Fields.
- Static Methods and Fields.
- Object oriented programming and design techniques.
- Encapsulation: Public and Private Methods, Public and Private Fields.
- Basic inheritance: Sub-classes and Overriding.
- Introduction to algorithms - searching and sorting.
- Simple complexity analysis, introduction to data structures.

## Learning Outcomes
- Students will be able to develop substantial programs to solve specific problems based on algorithms using standard data structures.
- Students will have an awareness of efficiency considerations for different algorithms.
- Students will be able to read and debug substantial programs written by others.
